## Introduction

**rzn.AI** is an AI learning tool to help students have an engaging and interactive learning experience. Whether you're a high schooler or college student or a teacher looking for a tool to recommend for your students, **rzn.AI** is for designed to learning things faster, smarter, and more efficiently.

## Features üöÄ

- **No time to make study materials? No problem!**: AI-generated flashcards and quizzes to test understanding.
- **Note-taking on autopilot**: Turn your lecture notes - video, audio, pdf, ppt - into organized exportable notes
- **Deep learning with rzn.AI**: Our key feature is our engaging voice chat AI to prime you into thinking deeper about concepts and problems for deep learning.
- **Latest technology**: rzn.AI is powered by the best AI models available at your choice for engaging learning such as DeepSeek R1, Claude 3.5, GPT-3.5, Gemini, and other LLM providers like Groq.

## Ethos
Our belief and mission is to make learning more engaging. Using AI, particularly through voice chat, we believe that students will be primed to think through their problem-solving by explaining their thinking process using rzn.AI. One of the outspoken downsides of using AI in learning, as many researchers, teachers, and students will attest, is that it forces students to outsource their critical thinking. The effect? Students are unable to think critically for themselves during high-stakes moments as they have become too reliant on AI technology. However, with rzn.AI, we approach that problem differently. Recently,  one of the biggest breakthroughs in AI technology has been the release of DeepSeek R1 and its chain-of-thought response by showing its thinking and explaining its problem-solving step by step. So we thought, "Can we flip the script on ourselves?" And so rzn.AI was conceived. We hope that our contribution to developing this software will aid in helping many learn differently and learn better using AI. As with everything, we do leave a disclaimer that these models are not always accurate and the users should be aware of the aforementioned legitimate concerns of using AI technology during learning. It's a tool to enhance your learning, not to do the 'learning' for you.
